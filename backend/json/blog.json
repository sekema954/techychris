    "intro": "## What Are Data Structures?\n\nData structures are ways to organize and store data so that operations like access, insertion, deletion, and traversal are efficient.\n\n### Common Types of Data Structures:\n- **Arrays**: Fixed-size structures to store elements of the same type.\n- **Linked Lists**: Nodes connected by pointers. Types include singly, doubly, and circular.\n- **Stacks & Queues**: LIFO and FIFO structures used in parsing, recursion, and scheduling.\n- **Trees**: Hierarchical structures like Binary Trees, BSTs, AVL Trees.\n- **Graphs**: Represent relationships. Can be directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted.\n- **Hash Tables**: Key-value pairs allowing fast lookup.",
    "middle_context": "## What Are Algorithms?\n\nAlgorithms are step-by-step procedures to solve problems or perform tasks. Efficiency is key, typically measured in Big-O time/space complexity.\n\n### Key Algorithm Categories:\n- **Sorting** (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort)\n- **Searching** (e.g., Binary Search)\n- **Recursion and Backtracking**\n- **Dynamic Programming**\n- **Greedy Algorithms**\n- **Graph Algorithms** (e.g., Dijkstra, BFS, DFS)\n\n## Why DSA Matters\n\n- **Improves Problem Solving**\n- **Crucial for Technical Interviews**\n- **Optimizes Performance**\n- **Helps Understand System Design**",
    "conclusion": "## Getting Started\n\n1. Pick a language (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).\n2. Practice problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces.\n3. Build projects using real-world data structure concepts.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nMastering DSA isn't about memorizing solutions. It's about developing an analytical mindset and writing clean, efficient code. With consistent practice, anyone can improve.\n\nHappy coding! ðŸš€",
